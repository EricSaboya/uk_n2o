### Abstract
Atmospheric measurements of trace gases can be used to independently assess national greenhouse gas inventories through inverse modelling. Here, measurements of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N$_{2}$O) made in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Republic of Ireland are used to derive N$_{2}$O emissions for 2013-2022 using two different inverse methods. We find mean U.K. emissions of $90.5\pm23.0\:(1\sigma)$ and $111.7\pm32.1\:(1\sigma)$ Gg N$_{2}$O yr$^{-1}$ between 2013-2022 with corresponding trends of $-0.68\pm0.48\:(1\sigma)$ Gg N$_{2}$O yr$^{-2}$ and $-2.10\pm0.72\:(1\sigma)$ Gg N$_{2}$O yr$^{-2}$, respectively for the two inverse methods. The U.K. National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) reports mean N$_{2}$O emissions of 73.9 Gg N$_{2}$O yr$^{-1}$ across this period, which is $14-33\%$ smaller than the emissions derived from atmospheric data. We infer a pronounced seasonal cycle in N$_{2}$O emissions, with a peak occurring in the spring and a second smaller peak in the late summer for certain years. The springtime peak has a long seasonal decline that contrasts with the sharp rise and fall of N$_{2}$O emissions estimated from direct flux measurements. Bayesian inference is used to minimize the seasonal cycle mismatch between the average top-down (atmospheric data-based) and bottom-up (process model and inventory-based) seasonal emissions at a sub-sector level. Increasing agricultural manure management and decreasing synthetic fertilizer N$_{2}$O emissions reduces some of the discrepancy between the average top-down and bottom-up seasonal cycles. However, other possibilities could also explain these discrepancies, such as missing emissions from NH$_3$ deposition, but require further investigation.
